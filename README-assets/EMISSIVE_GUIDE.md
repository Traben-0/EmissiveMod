## OptiFine compatability

- ETF supports all OptiFine emissive texture resource packs
- A custom emissive texture suffix may be set just like OptiFine but with a few optional changes, see the [emissive.properties](emissive.properties) example.
- Please try and use only the default emissive suffix `_e` it makes things easier for everyone :)

## Guide

- Emissive textures allow parts of a mob / entity's texture to glow as in the image above
- An emissive texture is a copy of the regular mob texture including only the parts you want glow
- To render correctly, the emissive texture should be the exact same size as the original mob's texture,<br />otherwise you may get Z-Fighting with shaders enabled
- Emissive textures must be in the same folder as the texture it is glowing over and must be named like this: `TextureName#.png`,<br />with `#` being the suffix set by the topmost OptiFine format resource pack,otherwise it will default to `_e`<br />(Meaning that the file name should be `TextureName_e.png`)
- Elytra & armour emissives have CIT Resewn mod support and will apply based on the CIT texture
- Tridents support emissive texturesand can be customized via the special case rules in the random / custom mob guide
- Block entities such as chests, shulker boxes, beds, bells, enchanting table & lectern books **support** emissive textures with ETF,<br />other blocks require [Continuity](https://modrinth.com/mod/continuity)
- Enhanced Block Entities (A mod which changes the block entity render to block render for performance optimizations)<br />breaks ETF's support for block entities 
- Player skins support emissive textures, see [player skin features guide](SKINS.md)

Emissive textures can render in two different ways, set by the config. The two images below show the two rendering modes:

### Dull Emmisives

<table>
<tr>
<td>
<img src="emissiveDull.png" alt="Dull Emissives" width="450">
</td>
<td>

They:

- Are like OptiFine emissives
- Are not overly bright in sunlight
- Have directional light shading (some sides are shaded differently)
- Have an upper brightness limit more inline with typical entity rendering
- Are expected to be more stable with certain shaders

Block entities will always use this mode unless Iris is installed, due to rendering issues in vanilla

</td>
</tr>
</table>

### Bright Emissives

<table>
<tr>
<td>
<img src="emissiveBright.png" alt="Bright Emissives" width="400">
</td>
<td>

They:

- Are brighter than OptiFine emissives
- Are noticeably bright in sunlight and can look out of style with vanilla
- Have more bloom with shaders
- Have global illumination and does not shade differently over the model
- Are brighter than the default Dull Emissives

</td>
</tr>
</table>


## Examples

<div align="center">

<img src="format_example.png" alt="Format example" width="450">

</div>

- The example image above shows red glowing eyes for the texture `zombie3.png`
- Emissives are applied after randomised textures and they must contain the same number system as the random files they apply too.<br/>For example, `zombie_e.png` will not apply to `zombie3.png`, but `zombie3_e.png` will

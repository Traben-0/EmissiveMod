## What does this mod do? ü§î

This Fabric & Forge mod adds support for many  _Entity Texture Features_ (:trollface:), including many entity-related texture features, using the OptiFine's format player skin features!  
This way, ETF provides more OptiFine parity on the Fabric mod loader. If you want more OptiFine features availiable on Fabric, you can either check [this list](https://lambdaurora.dev/optifine_alternatives), made by LambdaAurora, **or** you can use the [Fabulously Optimized modpack](https://modrinth.com/modpack/fabulously-optimized), which includes _all_ the OptiFine parity mods!

### Mod's features so far:

- üé≤ Custom & random entity textures with the OptiFine format, including biome, name and height properies, like OptiFine, with even more!
- üí° Emissive/glowing entity textures with the OptiFine format
- üòëÔ∏è Blinking mobs
- ‚öóÔ∏è Alternate potion visuals for mobs
- üé® Player skin features & additions, including support for most of the above features

Everything can be enabled, disabled or configured via Mod Menu settings menu, or by modifying the config file.

---

## Wiki & Guides

### üé≤ Random / Custom entity textures - [OptiFine]

<img src="readMeAssets/randoms.png" alt="img" width="650"/>

- For custom & random entity textures to work you can use a resource-pack that supports the
  **OptiFine format** for custom / random textures, including all Biome, Height, Name, etc. properties settings. and
  even more added by ETF
  - [***-> Random / Custom entity textures guide <-***](readMeAssets/RANDOM_GUIDE.md)

---
## üí° Emissive entity textures - [OptiFine]
<img src="readMeAssets/emissives.png" alt="img" width="650"/>

- For emissive & random entity textures to work you can use a resource-pack that supports the 
**OptiFine format** for emissive textures.   
  - [***-> Emissive entity textures guide <-***](readMeAssets/EMISSIVE_GUIDE.md)

## üé®  Player skin features

<img src="readMeAssets/capeex.png" alt="img" width="228"/>

- Player skins can use emissive, blinking, enchanted, transparency texture features, 
as well as other things like capes & jacket / dress extensions.
- these are 100% optional, controlled by the skin file you upload to Mojang, and options to prevent 
abuse of features in PVP
- Follow this guide to use these skin features
  - [***-> Player Skin Features guide <-***](readMeAssets/SKINS.md)
  - join the [[Discord]](https://discord.gg/rURmwrzUcz) if you still need help :)

## üòë Blinking feature
<img src="readMeAssets/blink.png" alt="img" width="650"/>

- Allows a textures to be set by a Resource-pack so that mobs can Blink randomly over a set period
- Mobs will blink periodically if they have a texture named "TEXTURE_blink.png"
- Optionally you can also use a texture named "TEXTURE_blink2.png" with the eyes half closed to have a smoother
  animation for large eyes like creepers
- Random blinking frequency can be altered in settings
- Sleeping mobs will have their eyes closed if possible
- Mobs with the Blindness potion effect will have either their eyes closed or half closed depending on what is available
- Player skins can support blinking, see player skin features...
- Resource-packs can set specific blinking length and frequency per texture via properties files next to the blinking
  texture, see below:  
  <img src="readMeAssets/blinkProperties.png" alt="img" width="300"/>

---

## ‚öóÔ∏è Alternate potion effects

- A setting in the config/mod menu settings, allows you to make it so mobs with potions effects can Glow, appear
  enchanted, or have creeper charge fields around them
- Mostly inspired by enchanted mobs in Minecraft Dungeons

---

## Settings & Configuration

- Settings can be changed in-game with Mod Menu, or the config file can be found at config/entity_texture_features.json
- A few of these options can also be changed via the Puzzle mod

<img src="readMeAssets/options.png" alt="img" width="650"/>

## Mod Support

- This mod should be compatible with any Mod added entities as long as they extend LivingEntityRenderer.class for
  rendering and utilise it correctly
- Any mod displaying an entity in a custom gui can force the default texture by having the entity.getblockstate be
  either null or of type VOID_AIR
- Settings can be altered ingame with Mod Menu
- fully supports iris but can vary between shaders
- fully sodium compatible

## Known Bugs

- Fresh animations also requires
  the [Custom Entity Models Mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/custom-entity-models-cem)
  and it's Dependencies. and not all mobs are fully supported.
- if you are experiencing LAG please check your most recent log file to see if any errors are being logged, sometimes an
  incorrectly written properties file or missing textures may lag the system.
- Please check any issue is not actually a problem in the properties file, a few packs seem to be pointing to a texture
  that doesn't exist.

- So far all Mob Entities support Random & Emissive textures though there may still be some quirks, if you find bugs you
  can reach me on the mod's [Discord](https://discord.gg/rURmwrzUcz)
- Complimentary shaders has its own inbuilt emissive textures that usually work fine but will conflict with some
  resource-packs *(you can disable either complimentary's emissives or my mods emissives to fix this).*
